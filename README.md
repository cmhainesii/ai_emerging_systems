# Emerging Trends / AI

## Description 

For this project, I created an AI agent that can solve mazes. The scenario is that an AI agent represents a pirate that is attempting to reach treasure before a human can. For this project, I was given the code for the game which included the maze in addition to functions that were required to set up the game and check for successful completion. The code for giving rewards based on actions taken by the agent was provided as well. The code that I added to this project was the pathfinding code that the agent used to train and eventually solve the maze. This was implemented as deep Q-learning which makes use of a neural network and reinforcement learning. 
  
## Computer Scientists 

I think of computer scientists as problem solvers. This may be because my studies focus mainly on developing software but at the most basic level, computers exist to solve problems. Going back to before humans figured out how to harness electricity, the most basic computers were used to make mathematical computations. Doing calculations manually is possible and the preferred method for a long time, but computers gave us a new way to solve that problem. A computer scientist is someone who knows about current technology and can make use of that knowledge to solve problems with it.  

I approach problems as a computer scientist with an open mind. The key word in computer scientist is scientist. Making use of the scientific method, a computer scientist is simply a scientist with knowledge of computers and related technology. I like to make use of this knowledge so I can solve problems more efficiently. I approach problems by first trying to understand the problem and eventually proposing a solution to the problem. Then after testing a solution, I can draw conclusions about the proposed solution and repeat the process. Anyone familiar with the scientific method will surely recognize these steps. 

My ethical responsibility to end users and organizations is to ensure that the things that I create are created responsibly. This means keeping threat actors in mind when developing solutions. This also means keeping security in mind and not implementing it as an afterthought. Many technologies have been compromised due to a lack of awareness of threat actors and how they may target a system. Many systems have been compromised because security was an afterthought and not part of the original design. By keeping these principles in mind, I aim to create systems and products that solve problems and minimize risk to organizations and society.
